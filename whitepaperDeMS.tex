\Abstract{Privacy concerns and the high demand of GPU capabilities are some of the main problems for real-time video processing when dealing with security and safety in the industry and urban areas, thus, generating high demand for suitable emerging technologies.  The rising power of small computers and the increasing capabilities of machine learning techniques are allowing us to design devices capable of detecting events in real time without the need of Internet connectivity or cloud computing access; therefore saving money and solving the increasing privacy problems for business and government institutions. In Deep Micro Systems we succeeded to combine several techniques to detect events in real-time video and exploit the combined information of several cameras connected to a single device, achieving a reasonable frame rate and sufficient resolution to capture the required details.}

Privacy concerns, reduced Internet connectivity, and low computational power are some of the main reasons to improve real-time video processing in local devices. The requirements for Internet connectivity and GPU services are some of the enormous problems that are particularly limiting in developing countries.

Computer vision has proved to be of great help for industries and governments aiming to increase security and safety at competitive prices. Embedded systems have limited power; thus, the need for novel computer vision techniques and new hardware are essential to handle more complex tasks.

Some specific tasks can offer some facilities to real-time video monitoring. That is the case of fixed cameras, surveillance cameras and security cameras that can handle only the changing pixels of video to reduce complexity or can make use of computer vision techniques to stabilize the frames in case of a sudden shake of the camera.

Simple computer vision techniques require low computational power and can be tailored to focus machine learning techniques on particular tasks.

New and more powerful small computers are also appearing such as Orange Pi, Raspberry Pi 3 B + and even neural sticks like Intel Movidius, which are capable of handling modern machine learning techniques.

\section{Deep Micro Systems}

Deep Micro Systems is a Bolivian Startup in the fields of Computer Vision and Smart Cities, with the mission to inform and to provide solutions to critical problems in the industry and government. 

\paragraph{Road Security} The high number of roads accidents is currently of great concern for the Bolivian government with about 1300 deaths every year. New technologies are needed to reduce these large numbers. As Internet connectivity in Bolivia is expensive and unreliable compared to our neighboring countries, the need for off-line processing is a major concern. To address this problem,  Deep Micro Systems designed an All-In-One device capable of detecting traffic Infringements, producing a visual proof of the act and at the same time generating valuable real-time data for city planning.

Our camera is capable of detecting events in real-time video identifying the vehicle violating the law.

\paragraph{Applications of computer vision} Besides road infringement detection, Deep Micro Systems works with computer vision systems with a broad perspective with applications in industry and government. Some of the other projects that Deep Micro Systems is planning to get involved in the short term are:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] % [noitemsep] removes whitespace between the items for a compact look
\item Optimal city design, parking, roads and flows
\item Traffic accidents forecast
\item Smart traffic light managing
\item Industrial applications of computer vision.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Industry} Local Bolivian business such as Enalbo and IBCO SRL expressed their interest in detecting real-time events such as security infringements
of their personal, abnormal functioning of equipment and other failures.

\subsection{All-In-One devices}

The lowering costs of pocket computers and the
increasing power and efficiency of machine learning techniques allow us to build small devices capable of solving important problems in urban areas and the industry without the need of Internet connectivity, guaranteeing privacy and cheaper uninterrupted work.

Computer processors such as Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC with 1.4GHz, and ARM H3 Quad-core Cortex-A7 with 1.6GHz are capable of handling complex tasks and can make use of the new neural chips to get even faster  results in real time.

All these components allow us to build custom devices for solving specific problems, providing Ethernet connectivity, GPS, GSM/GPRS, Bluetooth, WiFi and any sensors to be required.

	\caption{All-In-One computer vision device}
	\label{fig:device}
\end{figure}

Currently, Lu-Cam, our smart traffic enforcement camera is an 8x9x16 cm device capable, as seen in figure \ref{fig:device},and it is able of detecting events in real-time videos. Rather than getting frame features with convolutional neural networks, that would take several seconds to complete, we make use of the advantage of knowing the primary purpose, extracting only relevant features and making an improvement to less of a tenth of the time it would require otherwise.

%------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Real time monitoring and data analysis}

Such All-In-One Devices hold a huge advantage, allowing to pre-process data. For example,
real-time road monitoring could generate real-time histograms of infringements with proper labeling as shown in figure \ref{fig:histogram}. Then a central computer can handle data from several devices to make decisions, improving efficiency or automating complex processes.

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/histogram}
	\caption{Real time histogram}
	\label{fig:histogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[ht]\centering % Using \begin{figure*} makes the figure take up the entire width of the page
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/sync}
	\caption{Time synchronization between cameras}
	\label{fig:sync}
\end{figure*}

\section{Further applications}

\begin{figure}[h]\centering % Using \begin{figure*} makes the figure take up the entire width of the page
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/data}
	\caption{Real time Traffic Forecast}
	\label{fig:forecast}
\end{figure}
 
The applications for this kind of devices are endless. Real time monitoring and data analysis can lead us to a better understanding of cause problems and possible solutions to them thanks to data science and big data techniques.

Forecasting data is another example of an application of monitoring systems, in the case of real time traffic monitoring it can lead to traffic forecasting, saving thousands in time, fuel and possible accidents happening in streets and roads across Bolivia and the world, forecast is possible with a little amount of devices like shown in figure \ref{fig:forecast}



Real time simulation is also possible thank to the real time and flow data in the devices, allowing us to extrapolate data to points where it is not possible to place a monitoring device. Like aggressive environments in industries to complex roads in cities.
